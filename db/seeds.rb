# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  tkb = SchoolClass.create([{ title: 'TK' }, { room_number: 'TKA' }])
  1b = SchoolClass.create([{ title: '1B' }, { room_number: '18' }])
